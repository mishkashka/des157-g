          <h3>Zero Waste Movement</h3>
          <p> <br>Clearing out space and living a clutter free minimalistic life is great! But as we toss things out,
            there is a chance we might toss few things that would have been better recycled, composted or donated.
            <br> Getting rid of waste properly might be the next step, since we dont want our decluttering to become
            wastefulness.
            <br> What is Zero Waste Movement? Followers of the Zero Waste Movement abide by the Refuse, Reduce, Reuse,
            Recycle, and Rot mantra. It is about reducing our impact on the health of the planet by reducing the waste
            they produce. Learn more about how to Declutter waste free here: <a

          <h3>Mental Clutter</h3>
          <p><br> Ever feel like your brain is on overload? Just as we declutter our physical space, our minds too need
            tidying up from time to time. When we get rid of our mental baggage, we are able to think more clearly and
            stay focused.
            <br> Journaling is one of many great mind decluttering techniques anybody can do. "Writing a journal allows
            you to manage anxiety and cope with depression, as it’s a healthy outlet to release bottled emotions," -
            states a University of Rochester Medical Center report. <br> Learn more ways to declutter your mind and free

            idea to keep potted plants where you work as it will reduce stress and anxiety leading to better
            productivity.

          <h3>Organizing Clothes</h3>
          <p><br> The hardest part of decluttering the closet can be not knowing how to get started. Most people have
            multiple items in their closets that they rarely, or even never wear. But looking around at all the piles of
            clothing can leave a feeling of embarrasment and guilt, and that's a no-no, because it just makes you feel
            bad.<br>
            There are many methods to help with decluttering closets. The KonMari method is a system of simplifying and
            organizing your closet by getting rid of clothes that do not bring joy into your life. The positive thing to
            do is to let them go. But “letting go” doesn’t mean you can’t store or donate items! Here is the ultimate
            KonMari guide: <a href="https://www.livible.com/blog/ultimate-konmari-guide/" target="_blank">The Ultimate
              KonMari Guide</a>. You can also find KonMari's books here: <a href="https://konmari.com/collections/books"
