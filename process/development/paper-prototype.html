        <p> In class we ran two rounds of paper prototype testing. In the first round, I received important feedback from the tester on how to be more intentional with my UX. For example, having the instructions in the right location so the user don't miss
            it. To make sure the clickable objects are discernible from
            <thead>
                background image. Then I created my second round of prototype. This time I iterated and improved based on the first round of testing. In the second round of testing, the tester suggested to limit showing many screens with informations and directions,
                because the user only needs few seconds to uderstand the website.
